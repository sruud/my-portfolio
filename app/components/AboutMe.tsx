            Hi! I'm Steven. I am a web developer who is particularly good at
            front-end projects and testing software. I built my skills up in a
            time before AI agents were heavily incorporated into our workflows
            and have spent countless hours debugging and troubleshooting issues.
            I have professional experience maintaining legacy code, migrating
            projects to new technologies, and automating repetitive tasks. Over
            the years, I've contributed to Engineering, QA, and Customer Success
            teams, giving me a well-rounded perspective on software development
            and user needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I like to read about the current state of web
            development, experiment with TouchDesigner, and compose music. I
            also enjoy indoor rock climbing because it allows you to map out a
            plan and execute it on the fly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to try new things. 2024
            was the year when I participated in an in-person boot camp, joined
            and collaborated with a team, and submitted my first project in a
            hackathon ever at ETHDenver.
